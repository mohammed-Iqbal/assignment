**Vanilla JS Stopwatch**.



The stopwatch will start when the user clicks the play button and it will run every millisecond, displaying the full clock as 00:00:00:000 hours:minutes:seconds:milliseconds.

I thought I will be able to ADD few more extra functionalities but because of my laptop broke down I really couldn't add/commit more. I'm using my friend's PC.
